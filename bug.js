This error typically occurs when using Expo's `AsyncStorage` API in a React Native application and involves a mismatch between the expected data type and the actual data type stored.  The error message might not be explicit, but you'll see issues related to parsing or type coercion when retrieving items from `AsyncStorage`. For example, you might try to access a value as a number when it's actually stored as a string, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.   Let's say you store a number `123` but later try to use it in a calculation without converting it back from string representation.
